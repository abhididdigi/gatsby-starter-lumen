Happy New Year everyone!

Looking back 2017 was a good year for me.

Personally, I:

Moved from Denver, CO to New York area to Santa Clara, CA
vacationed Paris, France and Bruges, Beligum, not to mention the wonderful drive we did between Paris and Bruges, some pictures here:
Professionally, I

Joined #1 company in the world
So I'd definately qualify 2017 as one of the best years of my life.

Some of the things that I'd like to do in 2018

Be more interested in my Masters program. I have been postponing completing my masters for 2 years now. With me putting more years every year, I think it's time I take the program a bit seriously and complete it. This is the #1 on my list for 2018, complete atleast 3 courses this year.

Learn - AngularJS - Python - Redis - Docker and Kubernates - TensorFlow

Again, I'll be assesing the progress every month and see how I'm doing each month.

Read atleast 5 books in 2018. As a kid from the age 9 to 20, I was an avid reader. I used to read volumes of novels/ books and generally really into books. However all of this changed by the time I hit my 21st year. I stopped reading books altogether. I think 2018 should be the year that would rekindle my interest in books. I know 5 is a small number, but I'd like to start small.
Here's to a great 2018!
