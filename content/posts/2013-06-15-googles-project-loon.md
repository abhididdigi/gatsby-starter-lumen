<p>If you don&#8217;t know what <a href="http://www.google.com/loon/"> Loon </a> is, go ahead and take a look. Its something awesome.</p>

<p>We know India <strike>used </strike> to live in villages. But no more. Nevertheless, there are still people living in villages, and they do need internet. I would really be happy if this Operation Loon from Google kicks off and India gets better Internet.</p>
