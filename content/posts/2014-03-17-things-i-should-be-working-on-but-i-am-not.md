======================================================




This post is more on the personal side of me, so please feel to ignore it.

I've been doing a lot of travel these days, and not working on Service Now ideas as a whole. The new community is taking some time to adjust myself to. Community always acted as an entity which fueled my ideas. Now that I don't have many interesting community posts to look to, it's becoming very difficult to know what cool things people actually want.

These days I also see myself working more and more on the functional part of Service Now and not the Technical Part of it. This is really creating an issue along with other personal things, to build something which is actually very cool.

The things I want myself to create :


1. GIT for Service Now before Service Now releases one.

2. NodeJS file integration with Service Now.

3. I will want to complete a super secret project which helps you to audit the code in your Service Now instance.

4. Introduction Unit Tests in Service Now. I know what you are thinking - There is already a Utility by Chris Maloy on the same  : https://community.servicenow.com/people/Christopher.Maloy/blog/2012/08/24/2583
	... probably that the place I would start.
    
I personally believe with NodeJS, a powerful TDD utility can be created.


The above is the order in which I got these ideas, the priorities of these are :

3 >> 4 >> 2 >> 1
