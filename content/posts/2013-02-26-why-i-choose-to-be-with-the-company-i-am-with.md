======================================================




<p>I took an important decision today to stay with the company I am currently with. 
There are two reasons for it&#160;:</p>

<ol><li>I have a good manager, who is really very good to me. He makes me feel good, one of the primary reason to stay with the company.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve lots of free time. I work in  Service industry which allows me to concentrate on building up things that interest me.</li>
</ol>
