======================================================




Well, Bozeman is now officially my second home. I genuinely enjoy being amongst awesome folks here. It's a (small) town in Montana, that's world famous for Skiing. In contrast to Denver, here you would find more flat ski surfaces. Bozeman is also really close to Yellowstone national park, it takes about 1hr 30 mins to enter the Yellowstone National park.

I dig the clean air, calm atmosphere, good friends and mountains here. If you like Denver and Colorado, you'll love it here in Bozeman. 

P.S I don't ski. At all.
