======================================================




<p>Yes, you heard me right, I moved (finally) to Fedora19. I felt using Windows, I was missing out on many geeky features, So I completely moved to Fedora, set up my entire Dev Environment on it.</p>

<p>Will be using Windows for Games/Movies, Will be using Fedora for everything else.</p>
