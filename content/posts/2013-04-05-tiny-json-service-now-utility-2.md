title: Tiny JSON-Service Now utility
--- 



 {{page.title}}
======================================================




<p>Today, I started coding a tiiny JSON-Service Now utility, which will sit on the top of REST, and do Ajax calls for you and return back the JSON / Javascript Object.</p>

<p>Infact, you don&#8217;t require it&#8230; But I&#8217;m lazy to even make the Ajax calls everytime. So packing up GET, PUT , POST functions. Will be posting it on <a href="http://www.servicenowdiary.com"> Service Now Diary </a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m positive that this utiilty should be useful to people trying to do Rest calls over Service Now, with no Service Now background. It all started when i was in a dicussion about getting multiple objects from Script Includes. I&#8217;m not sure about the Network resources consumed.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
