======================================================




I had an interesting discussion with a manager of mine today. I was told Service Now started an 'App Store' just like all other big players out there.

So I got enrolled myself into the App store and I was given immediate access to it. 

It was a very pleasant feeling once I opened the App Store and saw there are about 500+ applications already uploaded. I get a feeling of uploading an add-on to Mozilla Firefox website. Service Now nicely parses the XML ( I hope with XML Helper ;)) and then chews out the different components like Business Rules, Client Scripts and Script Includes, and beautifies the code. I'm going to write a parser inside Service Now to do the same too, one day. It also validates if we have the usage of Package calls, and if there it, it raises a "Concern". A very good parser, I guess.


Coming to the quality of apps, I really don't see very good Applications, yet. Most of the interesting ones are from John Andersen, I'm still waiting for Mark to Upload his. The others didn't interest me much like the CI compare, JSON Glide Record generator etc, as they were already tested with long back in 2012 and 2011 here : https://community.servicenow.com/people/adiddigi/blog/2013/04/21/2524 and https://community.servicenow.com/people/adiddigi/blog/2013/04/21/2524

The second one is one the my favorite blog posts. 


My action plan for creation of Apps:

1. Data Migration from different tools into Service Now, by using a Feedback loop and continuous improvement.

2. Porting Jello to Service Now instances.

3. oAuth library for Service Now.
