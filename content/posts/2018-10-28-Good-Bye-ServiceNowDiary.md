===============

I have heard ServiceNow's legal team is harassing folks with "ServiceNow" in the name of their blog. I don't agree with them at all. I think they have lost it, and ServiceNow is increasingly becoming hostile to developers. I dont say this because they are sending notices to folks with the "ServiceNow" in their blog names. I say this because I'm slowly seeing ServiceNow becoming a more closed platform. 

Since one of my goals for 2018 was also to disassociate myself with "ServiceNow", it aligns with the timing that lawyers started sending notices AND the time www.servicenowdiary.com was up for renewal. 

So I decided not to renew www.servicenowdiary.com. 

All posts will still be available via www.daab.in (my personal blog URL).
