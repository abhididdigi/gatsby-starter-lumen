======================================================




<p>Finally yesterday,which was co-incidentally my birthday, i started learning <a href="http://nodejs.org"> Node.js </a>.</p>

<p>Prior to learning this, I had a modest understanding of HTML, CSS and Object Oriented Javascript.
I must say, i was pleasantly surprised with the simplicity in creating Applications with Node.js and the simplicity in adding new modules using NPM.</p>

<p>The tutorial that started me off is
-  <a href="https://tutsplus.com/lesson/hello-node-js/">https://tutsplus.com/lesson/hello-node-js/</a></p>

<p>This one is a premium tut from <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/">http://net.tutsplus.com/</a> , and it is really worth it.</p>
