title: Migration to Ghost from Wordpress

 {{page.title}}
======================================================




I've migrated my blog from Wordpress to Ghost. This decision was hard, but inevitable becasuse, there is just too much of work manitaining the entire website. Secondly for the sake of Modularity - Have the comments on Disqus, then Gist from Github for snippets and content from Ghost. 

I've migrated these directly from Wordpress, so there might be formatting issues with the code, for the posts that are already there.
