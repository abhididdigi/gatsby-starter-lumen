======================================================




<p>I don&#8217;t believe 3 years of experience should be enough for someone to decide about the qualities of a team that one should work with; But here is an attempt anyway.</p>

<ul><li>My team shouldn&#8217;t have the concept of  a Senior/Junior member.Everybody are equal, and everybody have the right to question others, regrading something technical - This way, we all grow together,learning from each other. The day when Superior feeling creeps in take my word for it, You and your team are screwed.</li>
<li>I should work with my manager, not for him.</li>
<li>I should be free to share anything, among the team, anytime. And sometimes outside the team(of-course, with the Intellectual property limits). We grow by sharing.</li>
</ul><p>And finally,  there should be proper amount of healthy cohesion among everybody in the  team. I believe every single person in the team is equally important, and has an equally important role in taking the team forward.</p>

<p>If I don&#8217;t find atleast  two of the above mentioned points in your team, I&#8217;m sorry.I won&#8217;t work for you.</p>

<p>This post written is keeping in mind an Indian Information Technology company set up.</p>
