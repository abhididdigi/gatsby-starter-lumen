title: A tiny data reconciliation engine in ServiceNow

 {{page.title}}
======================================================




Working with CMDB means you will need a very good reconciliation engine to load the data, compare it with already existing information in CMDB.

I have very minimal domain knowlege of just 1 year, so this is what I would think my top 3 features would be:

1. Ability to compare different keys with the data that's already present in ServiceNow and chew out the percentage of records that are similar.
2. Notice if there any changes that are made to ServiceNow by loading the input file, and if so, what are the changes.
3. Excellent error handling functionality.

I will try to author a tiny reconciliation engine in ServiceNow in coming days.
