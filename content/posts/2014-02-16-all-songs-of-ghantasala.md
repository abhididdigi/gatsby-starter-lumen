<p>I&#8217;m vexed with the current Telugu Music Industry. People like DeviSri Prasad, Taman are just copying music. Most of the time they copy the music from other film directors. Taman for Business Man movie had lifted most of the Italian songs like the theme from For a Few Dollars more, and other songs. DSP has started a trend of copying his own songs, just tweaking the lyrics. Every song in every Devi Sri prasad movie is the same, just the lyrics are different. I don&#8217;t blame them. I blame the Telugu Audience for that. Recently I facebook-ed the same point and I received responses that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I really don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s copied. I like the music, and so it is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the ultimate goal of music is to entertain, but that&#8217;s not the only one goal. It&#8217;s like you satisfied with what you are today, and so telling others that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;m today. I no longer want to improve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this mindset, you are not going anywhere in life, neither will Telugu Music Industry improve.</p>

<p>After 3-4 years of senseless, sapless music in Telugu Industry, I started slowing listening to Tamil songs, because the Music Directors there still try to give some good tunes, even today. Every weekend, I still listen to Top 10 of Tamil songs on <a href="http://www.saavn.com">www.saavn.com</a>, and they still look good.</p>

<p>Yesterday, by mistake I wanted to just listen to Telugu top ten on the same site, and that ruined my entire evening. Not a single song is good. Not a single song. All the songs are either lifted from one or the other movie, or the music director copying his own song.</p>

<p>At this juncture, I urge all the Audience of Telugu Film industry to just do a reality check, by listening to the great songs of Ghantasala and Rehmann. Rehman songs are easy to find, but Ghantasala&#8217;s is difficult. So I wrote a Script to pull in all the information about all the Ghantasala songs.</p>

<p>Here is how you can download around 600 Ghantasala songs, and store it in your local drive.</p>

<p>Run</p>

<p>pip install requests</p>

<p>and then</p>

<p>pip install beautifulsoup4</p>

<p>and run this script.</p>

<div class="gist_code_block">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/abhididdigi/9037921.js"></script></div>

<h6>##  Don&#8217;t run this code for more number of times. The person who maintained this site, doesn&#8217;t have much bandwidth for huge requests, and it will result in DDOSing the server.</h6>

<p>There are total of around 600 songs, and it will take 847 seconds. Save the Telugu music industry.</p>
