======================================================




<p>Add-on writing is a very complicated business. And for a novice like me in Add-on development(though i know Java Script to a certain extent) is really <strike>difficult</strike>.</p>
<p>I went through the basic setup today which will work with Context menus,panels and all ,which to be frank is really confusing. Initially i thought its very simple and i am almost one step away from getting my first version of this add-on. But then when i really went into details, Yes, It was(I presume will be) really complex.</p>
<p>The Idea was this&#160;:  When the user selects any text on the page, if that is an entry in task table,(mind you here comes the suitability of Service-now Tool. All the child tables&#8217; data references can be found in the task table.)and get its information in that little context box that comes up when he clicks on &#8221; What&#8217;s this Record&#8221;. Ah, I forgot,this option will be visible on the &#8220;right-click&#8221; menu when you select a particular text.</p>
<p>The Summary- The way the ADD-On should look&#160;:</p>
<p>1.It should have 2 things, One to look-up just as what I had explained.</p>
<p>2.Then the add-on should take a table and get the table&#8217;s data.</p>

<p>One Enhancement what is planned is&#160;: It should also try to get the user who had raised the particular incident/problem/Request.</p>
<p>Will this be possible in this very in-predictable life i am Living? Lets see.</p>
