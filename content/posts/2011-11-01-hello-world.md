I dedicate this post to 2 important people in this world. My mom and my dad.

Thanks a lot UmaShankar for your help and time and if I am posting this post on this site of mine, it is solely 'coz of you. Also, I thank Siva Prasad for guiding me on how a Website needs to be hosted,when I was in the darkness of not even knowing what an A record is. And if you are reading this post, you  _are_ really jobless.
