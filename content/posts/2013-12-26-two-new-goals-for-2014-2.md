title: Two new Goals for 2014
--- 



 {{page.title}}
======================================================




<p>I was going through some HackerNews links, and I stumbled upon the page of a developer called Mo Bitar. His <a href="http://bitar.io/about/">goals seemed</a> interesting to me. They inspired me. Hence, modifying them a teeny little bit and setting up my goals for 2014:</p>

<ul><li><p>To be absolutely calm in the face of disaster. To be absolutely calm and not speak if there is nothing to talk.</p></li>
<li><p>To get up and sleep early every single day.</p></li>
</ul><p>These are the two small goals, that I want to achieve in the year 2014. Happy new year!</p>

<p><i> Obligatory edit </i>&#160;: For some unknown reason, the autor Mo Bitar, chose to edit his goals today, rendering his special mention in this post a fallacy.</p>
