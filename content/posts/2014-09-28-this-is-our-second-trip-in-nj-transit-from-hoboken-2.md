======================================================




<p><p>This is our second trip in NJ Transit from Hoboken to Mahwah, to visit the temple up there on the eve of Dussera.</p>

<p>Also, because there was a lot of time, before we can come back, we thought we will go explore some trails. The closest thing we could go to was the Darlington Lake.</p>

<p>We took an Uber from the <a href="http://www.hindusamajmandir.org/">Hindu temple</a> to the (Darlington Lake). Below is the image of the Darlington Lake, there is not much to see there, except walk for an half hour. We saw some deer and some vultures.</p>

<p>The Hindu temple is awesome, it&#8217;s basically a Goddess Durga&#8217;s temple. The Architecture, dressing of the Gods and the rituals, are definitely NOT South Indian.</p>

<p>The walk from Mahaw to the Hindu temple was very pleasant. We had a part of lake which already looked dry, There are couple of houses which are both huge and awesome. You should definitely check this one out!</p></p><p></p><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/9a36a676cca02debe7714c4ad224e74c/tumblr_ncleanYqLo1rpvtsjo1_1280.jpg">
